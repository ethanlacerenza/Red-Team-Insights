# Red Team Insight

**Red Insight** is a knowledge repository focused on penetration testing, designed to help security professionals, ethical hackers, and penetration testers deepen their understanding of offensive security and exploit development. This repository covers a wide range of topics, from vulnerability scanning to privilege escalation and beyond.

## 📜 Overview

The goal of **Red Insight** is to provide a detailed collection of notes, techniques, and practical examples in penetration testing, divided into various sections to make it easier to find relevant content. Each section offers structured insights on specific phases of a penetration test, making it suitable for both beginners and advanced users.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Before you dive in, it's recommended that you have a basic understanding of:
- Networking and system administration
- Command-line interfaces (Linux/Windows)
- Common penetration testing tools (Nmap, Metasploit, Burp Suite, etc.)

The repository is structured based on key penetration testing areas and techniques, following the timeline of a typical engagement.
